# Fordgobike Trip
## by Ephraim Opoku-Agyeman


## Dataset

> This dataset was recorded on bicycle trips, where we have the first half of the dataset about the `start_station` and `end_station`, in relation to their locations, represented with `longitudes` and `latitudes` and finally the `Ids` of the various stations. 

>The second half of the dataset is about the bikers themselves, which includes how old they are - `member_birth_year`, how long it took to ride to the end_stations as `duration_sec` and finally, their gender as `member_gender`.

>The Dataset used was provided by the udacity team. During the data wrangling, cleaning was done at the removal of NaN rows. Other columns were established from the some existing columns for furthur analysis.


## Summary of Findings

Univariate plots
> Among all bikers, males were dominant, almost two and a half of females with about 90% being subsrcibers. The highest distance that was covered in the trips was around 0 km to 2 km and the most time taken for the trip was 30 mins. Overall, people of age 30 were the most in this activity.

Bivariate plots
> The first bivariate plot was between the ages of bikers who participated and how far they could go. According to that plot, those at the age of 30 covered around 15kms. As the ages moved from 30 to 90, the kilometers covered diminished. Onwards to the next plot, most people used 2 to 3 hours to take the trips. People from 25 to 50 could stay longer, but most values above are outliers since in the univariable plottings, the max duration was 2 hours.

> According to plots made, the maximum distance is 10 km and this was taken by very few bikers. Most bikers rode to 5 km under 2 to 3 hours. A few others took long hours to ride a journey of 5km. Females rode a longer distance generally than males and took the most time. Over all males are the most subsribers and has the most customers.

Multivariate plot
> According to the Multivariate plot made, females and males have very similar results. However, the males exceed the females by a small margin. 

## Key Insights for Presentation

> In the presentation I would expound on: the relationship between between distance and time, distance and gender,  and finally distance, time and gender.
